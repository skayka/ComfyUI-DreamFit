## Installation

### Prerequisites
- ComfyUI installed and working
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git (for installation method 1)

### Method 1: Git Clone (Recommended)
```bash
# Navigate to your ComfyUI custom nodes directory
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/skayka/ComfyUI-DreamFit.git

# Navigate to the installed directory
cd ComfyUI-DreamFit

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: Download models (do this after restarting ComfyUI)
python download_models.py
```

### Method 2: ComfyUI Manager
If you have [ComfyUI Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) installed:
1. Open ComfyUI Manager
2. Search for "DreamFit"
3. Click Install
4. Restart ComfyUI

### Method 3: Manual Installation
1. Download the repository as ZIP
2. Extract to `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-DreamFit`
3. Open a terminal in the extracted directory
4. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Download Models
After installation, download the required DreamFit models:

```bash
# Navigate to the ComfyUI-DreamFit directory
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-DreamFit

# Download all models (855MB total)
python download_models.py

# Or download specific models
python download_models.py --model flux_i2i
python download_models.py --model flux_tryon

# List available models
python download_models.py --list

# Verify downloaded models
python download_models.py --verify
```

The models will be automatically downloaded to:
- If inside ComfyUI: `ComfyUI/models/dreamfit/`
- Otherwise: `./dreamfit_models/`

### Troubleshooting Installation

#### "No module named 'folder_paths'" during install
This is normal! The installation will complete successfully. This error only appears because the installer tries to verify the installation outside of ComfyUI.

#### Models not found
1. Make sure you've downloaded the models using `python download_models.py`
2. Check that models are in `ComfyUI/models/dreamfit/`
3. Restart ComfyUI after downloading models

#### Import errors in ComfyUI
1. Make sure you've installed requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Restart ComfyUI after installation
3. Check the ComfyUI console for specific error messages

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Image Quality**: Use high-quality garment images with clean backgrounds
2. **Prompts**: Be specific about the desired style and context
3. **Injection Strength**: Start with 0.5 and adjust based on results
4. **Sampling Steps**: 20-30 steps usually sufficient
5. **CFG Scale**: 7-8 works well for most cases

| Model | Size | Description | Best For |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| flux_i2i | 284MB | Basic garment generation | General fashion images |
| flux_i2i_with_pose | 284MB | Pose-controlled generation | Specific poses/positions |

## Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'dreamfit_core'"
- Ensure you're in the correct directory when installing
- Try `python -m pip install -e .` from the ComfyUI-DreamFit directory

### Models not downloading
- Check internet connection
- Try running with specific model: `python download_models.py --model flux_i2i`
- Manually download from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/bytedance-research/Dreamfit) and place in `ComfyUI/models/dreamfit/`

### Out of memory errors
- Reduce batch size to 1
- Use CPU offloading in ComfyUI settings
- Try the fp16 versions of models

## Technical Details

DreamFit uses:
- **Anything-Dressing Encoder**: 83.4M parameter encoder for garment features
